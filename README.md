# Waterloo Math Work Report LaTeX Template

This is a fork of [@cosbynator's LaTeX template](https://github.com/cosbynator/Waterloo-Math-Work-Report-LaTeX-Template) for writing work reports in the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo.

Clone it, look at `lorem.tex` for a sample and make sure to include `mathwkrpt.sty` in your own file.

Please double check that this fits with the [current work report formatting standards](https://math.uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/co-op-information/work-report-guidelines) before relying on it.
